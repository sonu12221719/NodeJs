1. what is client and server sides?
   
**Client-Side:-**
- The client-side refers to the part of a software application that runs   on the user's device (typically a web browser in the context of web development).
-  It is responsible for the user interface, user experience, and client-side logic.
-  Client-side technologies include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are executed in the user's browser.
-  The client interacts with the user directly and sends requests to the server for data or additional resources.
  
**Server-Side:-**
-  The server-side refers to the part of a software application that runs on the server or backend.
-  It is responsible for processing requests, managing databases, executing server-side logic, and generating dynamic content.
-  Server-side technologies include languages like Node.js, Python (Django, Flask), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Java (Spring), PHP, and more.
-  The server responds to client requests, performs necessary computations, retrieves data from databases, and sends the results back to the client.
